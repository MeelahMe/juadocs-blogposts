 ## Introduction


Documentation is one of the most powerful tools in software development—but only when it’s done well. Developers rely on documentation to onboard quickly, troubleshoot effectively, and build confidently. But when documentation is outdated, unclear, or siloed, it becomes a bottleneck instead of a bridge.

That’s why docs-as-code has emerged as a foundational shift in how we approach technical content. Instead of treating documentation as an afterthought, docs-as-code brings it into the same workflows, tools, and systems developers use to build software—making docs more accurate, more trusted, and more scalable.


## What Is Docs-as-Code?


Docs-as-code is a methodology that treats documentation like code. That means writing content in plain text formats like Markdown or reStructuredText, storing it in version control (like GitHub or GitLab), and integrating it into your CI/CD pipeline.

This approach turns documentation into a living part of the development cycle. Writers and engineers alike can contribute using pull requests, reviewers can catch errors before docs go live, and teams can track changes over time—just like they do with software.

By aligning documentation with the development process, docs-as-code reduces the gap between code and content, ensuring developers always have access to accurate, up-to-date information.

Don’t worry about sounding professional. Sound like you. There are over 1.5 billion websites out there, but your story is what’s going to separate this one from the rest. If you read the words back and don’t hear your own voice in your head, that’s a good sign you still have more work to do.

Be clear, be confident and don’t overthink it. The beauty of your story is that it’s going to continue to evolve and your site can evolve with it. Your goal should be to make it feel right for right now. Later will take care of itself. It always does.


## Why Docs-as-Code Improves Developer Experience

Version Control Builds Trust  

When docs live in Git, developers can trace changes, track history, and trust that what they’re reading reflects the current state of the system.

Developers Can Contribute Easily  

Docs-as-code makes it simple for engineers to fix typos, clarify examples, or add details right where they’re working. This turns documentation into a shared responsibility.

Automation Enforces Consistency  

Docs-as-code supports automated linting, formatting, and style checks. These safeguards create large-scale consistency, making your content easier to read and maintain.

It Fits Into Existing Dev Workflows  

Developers don’t need to learn new tools. They write, review, and deploy documentation in the same systems they already use for code.


## Real-World Example: My Experience at InfluxData

At InfluxData, I was tasked with documenting the write path architecture for both InfluxDB Core and Enterprise. Because the documentation lived in Git and followed a docs-as-code workflow, I wasn’t working in isolation—I collaborated directly with engineers through pull requests, received inline feedback, and iterated quickly.

This workflow not only kept my docs accurate and in sync with product changes—it made them more respected. I was able to ship updates alongside feature releases and ensure developers had exactly what they needed when they needed it. Docs weren’t an afterthought—they were part of the product.


## Getting Started with Docs-as-Code

Here’s a quick-start checklist for adopting a docs-as-code workflow:

Use plain text formats like Markdown or reStructuredText  

Store documentation in the same repository as your code  

Use GitHub or GitLab for version control and PR-based review  

Automate previews and style checks with CI tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Netlify, Vale)  

Create a contributor guide and style guide to keep content consistent  

Encourage both writers and developers to contribute


## Conclusion

Docs-as-code isn’t just a tooling choice—it’s a mindset. It brings documentation into the core of product development, where it belongs. By aligning writing with coding, teams build trust, reduce support burden, and deliver better experiences for developers.

If you’re ready to transform your documentation from a bottleneck into a strategic asset, docs-as-code is the way forward.
