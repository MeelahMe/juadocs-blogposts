## Introduction

Before a self-driving car can steer, it has to see.

Computer vision gives autonomous vehicles the ability to interpret the world through cameras—transforming raw pixels into structured information that guides real-time decisions. It’s one of the most powerful components of autonomy—and also one of the most complex.

During my internship at Circuit Launch, I built a miniature self-driving car from the ground up. Using a front-facing camera, I collected training data, developed a convolutional neural network using Keras and TensorFlow, and deployed a behavioral cloning model to control the car in real time.

This post explores the fundamentals of computer vision in autonomous vehicles—what it is, how it works, and what I learned by teaching a robot to drive.

## What Is Computer Vision?

Computer vision (CV) is the field of study focused on enabling machines to interpret and act on visual data. In the context of autonomous vehicles, that means transforming input from cameras into meaningful insights—like identifying lane markings, detecting obstacles, or tracking other vehicles in motion.

At its core, CV is about converting pixels into perception.

Every image captured by a vehicle’s camera is just a grid of color values. A human brain can instantly recognize a stop sign or a curve in the road—but for a machine, it takes layered processing and pattern recognition to make sense of that scene. This is where deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), comes in.

CNNs are designed to detect patterns in visual data—edges, shapes, and increasingly complex features—through multiple layers of filtering. By training these models on thousands of driving images and steering labels, a car can "learn" how to navigate a road based on visual context.

In my project, computer vision was the foundation of everything. Without it, the car had no awareness—no ability to react, self-correct, or drive. The visual data was its entire interface with the world.

## How It Works in Autonomous Vehicles

In a self-driving system, computer vision is part of a larger decision-making pipeline. Cameras capture continuous video of the environment—lanes, signs, objects—while deep learning models analyze each frame to determine what the vehicle should do next.

At Circuit Launch, I built a miniature autonomous vehicle that mimicked this real-world pipeline at a smaller scale. The project centered around behavioral cloning, a type of imitation learning where a neural network learns to copy the behavior of a human driver by observing inputs and actions.

### Step 1: Data Collection
I drove the car manually along a training track while a front-facing camera captured video, and the steering angle was logged in real time. These paired inputs (video frames + steering commands) formed the dataset for training.

### Step 2: Model Training with CNNs
Using Keras and TensorFlow, I built a Convolutional Neural Network that could predict steering angles from raw images. The model was trained on thousands of frame-steering pairs, learning to associate visual cues—like curves, shadows, and lane edges—with directional behavior.

### Step 3: Deployment and Real-Time Inference
Once trained, the model was deployed back onto the car. Now, instead of me steering, the car processed images from its camera and predicted how it should turn—frame by frame, in real time.

### Step 4: Testing + Troubleshooting
The process didn’t end with deployment. I continuously iterated on the model—troubleshooting hardware issues, refining the dataset, and improving model performance in edge cases like glare or poor lighting.

The end result was a self-contained vision-based navigation system. It wasn’t perfect, but it was proof: with the right data and a well-tuned model, a camera alone can be enough to drive a vehicle.

## Challenges in Computer Vision for Autonomy

Computer vision is powerful—but it’s also fragile. In the context of autonomous systems, small environmental or hardware changes can have a massive impact on performance.

### Lighting and Visual Noise
One of the first challenges I encountered was lighting inconsistency. Sudden shadows, glare, or overexposed areas in the frame confused the model, especially in corners where visual contrast was low.

### Hardware Reliability
Working with robotics added another layer of complexity. Loose wires, jittery motors, or slight misalignments in the camera mount affected how the car moved and what it saw.

### Data Quality and Bias
Training data is everything in imitation learning. If the car was overexposed to straight road segments and underexposed to sharp turns, it would struggle in curves. I had to actively rebalance the dataset and prune out "bad driving" to improve generalization.

### Real-Time Performance
Even with a small model, real-time inference required efficient preprocessing and tight integration between the model and motor control system. Latency—even a fraction of a second—could cause the car to overcorrect or drift.

## Why It Matters

Computer vision is more than a buzzword—it’s a core enabler of autonomy. It allows machines to operate in dynamic, human-centered environments without relying on expensive or high-complexity sensors. That’s why it’s foundational not only in self-driving cars, but also in warehouse robotics, agricultural automation, drone navigation, and even healthcare tools that interpret medical imaging.

My experience building a miniature self-driving car gave me a front-row seat to this transformation. It showed me how much power—and responsibility—comes with teaching a machine how to perceive. It also reminded me that autonomy is never just about the model. It’s about the entire system working together: the data, the sensors, the processing pipeline, and the physical world.

When computer vision works well, it can navigate chaos with confidence. But getting there requires more than just training a neural network. It demands intention, iteration, and a willingness to work across disciplines—from code to circuitry to camera placement.

## Conclusion

Computer vision is transforming the way autonomous systems navigate the world—enabling them to see, interpret, and act with increasing sophistication. Through my internship at Circuit Launch, I experienced firsthand how these systems come together: from raw pixel data to a trained model, and from a steering angle prediction to a physical response on the road.

Building a miniature self-driving car taught me that autonomy is never about one component—it’s the harmony between software, hardware, and iterative learning. Training a convolutional neural network is just one part of the equation. Real-world performance depends just as much on clean data, reliable sensors, efficient control systems, and clear documentation.

Computer vision is still an evolving field, but its role in autonomy is foundational. Whether at the scale of a test track or an urban city grid, the ability for a machine to perceive and respond to its environment will continue to shape the future of robotics, transportation, and intelligent systems.
